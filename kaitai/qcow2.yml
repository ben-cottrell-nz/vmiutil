        doc: |
          Offset into the image file at which the backing file name
          is stored (NB: The string is not null terminated). 0 if the
          image doesn't have a backing file.

          Note: backing files are incompatible with raw external data
          files (auto-clear feature bit 1).
      - id: backing_file_size
        type: u4
        doc: |
          Length of the backing file name in bytes. Must not be
          longer than 1023 bytes. Undefined if the image doesn't have
          a backing file.
      - id: cluster_bits
        size: 4
        doc: |
          Number of bits that are used for addressing an offset
          within a cluster (1 << cluster_bits is the cluster size).
          Must not be less than 9 (i.e. 512 byte clusters).
          
          Note: qemu as of today has an implementation limit of 2 MB
          as the maximum cluster size and won't be able to open images
          with larger cluster sizes.
          
          Note: if the image has Extended L2 Entries then cluster_bits
          must be at least 14 (i.e. 16384 byte clusters).
      - id: size
        type: u8
        doc: |
          Virtual disk size in bytes.
          
          Note: qemu has an implementation limit of 32 MB as
          the maximum L1 table size.  With a 2 MB cluster
          size, it is unable to populate a virtual cluster
          beyond 2 EB (61 bits); with a 512 byte cluster
          size, it is unable to populate a virtual size
          larger than 128 GB (37 bits).  Meanwhile, L1/L2
          table layouts limit an image to no more than 64 PB
          (56 bits) of populated clusters, and an image may
          hit other limits first (such as a file system's
          maximum size).
